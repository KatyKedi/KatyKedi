# Hello GitHub community! 
I'm ✨*Katy Vincent*✨, and I am hoping to find some great programmers to learn from and collaborate with as I work on gaining real world coding experience. Right now, I'm looking into graduate school and trying to decide on a university that has a strong computational focus. I'm open to any advice and suggestions! 

## Education
I hold a **Linguistic Bachelor's degree** from the University of California in Santa Barbara. Currently, I'm working on earning a certificate from the UC Davis coding bootcamp to add computational skills to my resume. My end goal in academics is to become a full-fledged computational linguist that can work in the field or become a professor of Linguistics/Computational Linguistics.
