Hello GitHub community! I'm ✨KatyKedi✨, a Linguist with a Bachelor's degree 
from the University of California in Santa Barbara. I am hoping to find 
some great programmers to learn from and collaborate with as I work on gaining 
real world coding experience. Right now, I'm looking into graduate school and 
trying to decide on a university that has a strong computational focus. I'm open 
to any advice and suggestions! 

Now, a little about me: I love my little pupper, his name is 💞️Dizzy💞️. 
Dead By Daylight is my favorite game right now, but I'll stan Sonic Adventure 2, 
Jak and Daxter, and Skyrim forever. I miss performing ballet, dance is another 
passion of mine. Other than that, I'm always happy to paint, craft, read. I'm
attempting to teach myself Turkish currently, and would also like to refresh my
Spanish and ASL skills. So, if anyone is looking for a language partner, the 
practice would be greatly appreciated.

I can be reached at kak@ucsb.edu or katykat5bros@gmail.com
