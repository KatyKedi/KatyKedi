# Hello GitHub community! 
I'm *Katy Vincent*, and I am hoping to find some great programmers to learn from and collaborate with as I work on gaining real world coding experience. I will applying to schools to pursue a Masters in Computational Linguistics. I'm open to any advice and suggestions! 

## Education
I hold a **Linguistic Bachelor's degree** from the University of California in Santa Barbara. Additionally, I hold a certificate from the Coding Bootcamp through UC Davis. My end goal in academics is to become a full-fledged computational linguist that can work in the field or become a professor of Linguistics/Computational Linguistics.
